<H1>The Role of Biomass in America's Energy Future (RBAEF)</H1>

<P>RBAEF is an ongoing project jointly led by Dartmouth College and the 
<A HREF="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</A> (NRDC),
 and sponsored by the 
<A HREF="http://www.energy.gov/">U.S. Department of Energy</A>, the 
 Energy Foundation, and the 
<A HREF="http://www.energycommission.org/">National Commission on Energy Policy</A>.
</P>

<P>
RBAEF is a multi-institution, multi-sponsor project initiated in the spring of 
2003 with two primary objectives: 
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Identify and evaluate paths by which plant biomass can make a large 
contribution to meeting future demand for energy services. </LI>
<LI>Determine what can be done to accelerate biomass energy use 
and in what timeframe associated benefits can be realized. </LI>
</OL>


<H2 class="padding">What's Different About This Project?</H2>

<P>
The project is differentiated from previous efforts by the breadth 
of technologies considered, the diversity of organizations involved 
(technical, environmental advocacy, policy), and its forward-looking character. 
With respect to the latter, our analysis is focused on mature technology 
that can reasonably be expected in the future given a concerted effort. 
In addition, we consider the possibility of changes to the status quo that 
leverage the benefits of advanced energy supply technologies, including 
high productivity energy crops, high vehicle efficiency, and integrated
 food and energy production. </P>
 
<H2 class="padding"> Working Hypotheses Under Consideration</H2>

 
<UL>
<LI>
The fraction of energy services that could be obtained from biomass is 
much larger than has been considered in most analyses to date.</LI>

<LI>
Such large-scale provision of energy services could be accomplished 
with environmental benefits and without using a large amount of new land.</LI>

<LI>
Fuel produced from cellulosic biomass is a legitimate option as a primary 
energy carrier for the U.S. transportation sector over the indefinite future.</LI>

<LI>
Innovation, change, and increased energy efficiency are essential 
features of most if not all paths to a sustainable and secure energy future.</LI>
